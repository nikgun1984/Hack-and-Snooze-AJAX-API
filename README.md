Hacker News is a tech news aggregator founded by Paul Graham, the man behind Y Combinator. It is one of the best sources online for intellectually stimulating news, and its content is not just limited to software technology. In this project, I made a functioning clone of Hacker News using Hacker or Snooze API, jQuery and axios JS library. You can add/delete/update/favorite your stories(Note: you can favorite/unfavorite other people stories although you cannot delete/edit them, only yours) and add/update user. You can try and see how it works in action. The link is provided above. Have fun :)))
